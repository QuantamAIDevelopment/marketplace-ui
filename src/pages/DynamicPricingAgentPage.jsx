            <h2>Example Use Case</h2>
            <p>
              An e-commerce manager wants to optimize prices for 500+ products based on inventory levels, competitor pricing, and sales trends. By uploading a CSV of their current catalog, the Dynamic Pricing Agent instantly recommends new prices, explains the rationale (e.g., "Stock running low, price increased by 10%"), and provides a timestamped audit trail. This enables rapid, data-driven pricing decisions that maximize revenue and reduce manual effort.
